        Packaging is the primary touch point for any consumer packaged Goods
        brand. So in order to create an amazing packaging design, you have to
        start with the brand put simply a brand is the trade name given to a
        product or service.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        However, we all know a brand encompasses so much more than that a brand
        is the emotional and factual identifiers that come to mind when we
        recall a product the brand identity includes everything from advertising
        creative to signage Vehicles uniforms prep materials web presence social
        media personality to product names and yes packaging design your
        packaging design should visually tell the story of your brand including
        what makes it unique and differentiates it from competitors in the
        marketplace.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        What is your brand promise? Is it quality safety value convenience
        performance or a mix of all of these how do you articulate that there
        are combination of three-dimensional materials and structure and
        Two-dimensional visual elements in this section, you will learn the
        basics of branding we&apos;ll start with how a brand protects itself
        with trademarks and copyrights.

      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        Then we&apos;ll discuss color theory typography and the all-important
        brand guidelines and style guide if you develop packaging for an
        established company or a firm that works with established companies.
        You&apos;ll most likely be provided with brand guidelines and style
        guides these outline colors and typography choices agreed upon by the
        product owner is required usage for the design and implementation of
        their brand and logo on packaging assets.

        But what if you&apos;re working on a project where you don&apos;t have a
        style guide or branding information? No sweat we&apos;ll get you up to
        speed with a workshop to develop your own ultimately. This section is
        about understanding the brand you are working with and making sure that

        Welcome to the lecture on color theory and symbolism. The goal of this
        lesson is to give you the tools you need to understand color and how to
        select and manage colors for your packaging design. This will guide you
        to ultimately creating a color palette part of the comprehensive brand
        style guide.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        A style guide is essential for proper packaging design the fonts and
        colors are selected based on logic derived through centuries of trial
        and error and exploring nature. These are not haphazard selections and
        these guides help your teammates. Keep a consistent look and feel to
        your product lines.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        So you need to create a style guide selecting only a few colors to
        visually complement and communicate your product. 80% of visual
        information is related to color. So it's advantageous to use color in
        your packaging. But there are millions of colors to choose from and
        narrowing it down to two or three can seem like an impossible task. This
        is because selecting colors is both highly subjective and highly
        scientific many times. We are trying to satisfy our clients but
        effective color choices go much deeper. They have a tremendous ability
        to influence emotion and attention both consciously and subconsciously
        as a designer, you have to balance color science or color theory and the
        psychological aspects of color how they impact the viewers emotion and
        mood.

      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        The color wheel of 12 colors is the best way to explain color theory.
        The wheel is a tool to understand color mixing as a painter would there
        are primary colors red yellow and blue mix these and you get the
        secondary colors orange green and violet.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        Mix secondary and primary colors and you get the tertiary colors red
        orange yellow orange yellow green blue green blue violet red violet. And
        now we have all 12 colors on the Wheel. The primary and secondary colors
        plus Indigo represent the visible light spectrum literally all the
        colors of the rainbow and can be remembered by the acronym Roy G. Biv
        takes us back to Middle School.

      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        Before we get into color Harmony the science behind using the color
        wheel to create color palettes. Let's make sure we understand the basic
        vocabulary Hue is synonymous with color or the name of a specific color
        and traditionally refers to one of the 12 colors on the color wheel.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        Shade refers to a hue darkened with black tone is a hue dulled with gray
        and tint is a hue lightened with white. Saturation refers to the
        intensity or purity of a color the closer a hue approaches to gray the
        more desaturated. It is and value refers to the lightness or darkness of
        a color pure colors or Hues tints and shades are important in relevant
        to Packaging.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        Pure colors are bright and cheerful. They give a feeling of Joy Youth
        and energy think of a kindergarten classroom or the cereal aisle at your
        grocery store those saturated primary and secondary colors are
        everywhere.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        Tint is pure color mixed or overlaid with white creating tints or
        pastels these softer colors exude tranquility and peace. They are
        commonly used in marketing Beauty and Healthcare packaging to Target
        women shades are pure colors with added black. They are generally
        aligned with masculine design.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        It's very clear in axis product line x black manly There are two primary
        mixing models subtractive and additive the subtractive is what we just
        went over in packaging. We print in CMYK where we mix these four colors
        to achieve most of the colors. We need in print the additive model
        involves mixing light like RGB.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        Computer monitors and other digital displays achieve these Colors by the
        mixing of light if you were to look closely at each pixel in your
        monitor. They are composed of three small lights are GB. There are many
        digital versions of the color wheel which are very convenient and should
        be used as we move into color harmonies the Crux of color theory.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        When you're working on a design project that will be printed your
        computer monitor can't accurately display colors as they will look on
        paper what you see is not what you get. Because the RGB color space uses
        a wider color spectrum than CMYK. It's worth noting that some designers
        like to initially create a print project in RGB for more color options,
        then convert the finished design to CMYK before printing.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        Due to these differences designers need a way to get consistent color
        results when working with both systems. For instance. If you're
        designing a logo to use on your website, but also want to get a business
        card printed. That's where the Pantone matching system or PMs can help.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        Colors can be matched for web and print as well as for different types
        of printing surfaces to ensure a uniform appearance. The Pantone system
        makes it easy for designers clients and printers to collaborate and
        ensure that the final product looks as intended.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        These men are the fathers of the color wheel we used today in the early
        1700s Newton split light into colors forming the color wheel the tool we
        used to implement color theory a few decades later. Both complicated the
        Wheel by defining warm and cool colors shaping our understanding of
        color psychology and symbolism and in the 1940s it and combined the
        theories of his predecessors and arranged colors in an easy-to-use Star
        graphic the color wheel has evolved over time, but always relies on two
        major Concepts. One being that the warmth or coolness of colors can be
        used emotionally that they have an effect on the mood and behavior of
        the audience. The other is mathematical the colors work best in specific
        relationships or theoretical harmonies.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        These relationships help to communicate and are generally agreed to be
        aesthetically pleasing. So first the color circle can be divided into
        warm and cool colors as a general rule designing with an excessive
        combination of warm and cool colors can confuse the viewer. It can often
        make the design seem busy dirty and untrustworthy warm colors are used
        to reflect passion happiness and enthusiasm and energy while cool
        colors. Give a sense of calm and professionalism.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        And for the mathematical there are six primary color harmonies that
        artists have used for centuries each requires designation of a specific
        dominant color either because of how much it appears within the design
        or how much the color should stand out within the design. This dominant
        color is used to build the following color harmonies monochromatic
        analogous complementary split complementary triadic and double
        complementary. Complementary relationships are as close to black and
        white as color gets these colors are directly opposite from each other
        on the wheel like red and green or blue and orange and represent two
        distinct Parts. They stand out more than any other color relationship.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        The high contrast and high intensity of complementary colors can be
        difficult to apply in a balanced harmonious way, especially in their
        purest form when they can easily clash in a design.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        Analogous combinations are literally the opposite of complementary.
        These are colors that exist next to each other on the color wheel, they
        don't stand out from one another but blend together well to present
        aesthetic complexity. They are seen as a related unit a whole piece of
        the pie as it were.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        Triadic color harmonies are visually exciting though not as harsh as
        complementary. They are distinct colors that do Stand Out unlike
        analogous which work as one unit triadic combinations represent unique
        and distinct relationships that are more similar than complementary
        while complementary relationships are powerful in high contrast. They
        can be a bit harsh and split complementary sometimes fills the need
        better.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        Split complementary combines the distinction of complementary schemes
        with analogous designs. The result is one primary color with two related
        notes split complements are created with any color on the color wheel
        plus the two that flank its complement.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        This scheme still has strong visual contrast, but is less jarring than a
        complementary color combination. Monochromatic is simple design using
        various Shades tones or tints of a single color for instance a range of
        Blues varying from light to dark monochromatic designs are inherently
        Lush and luxurious but need careful attention to communicate effectively
        as they are also more subtle and conservative than multi-tone designs.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        Although this choice is efficient on print cost your printable substrate
        becomes very important here. This design strategy is common for
        homogeneous Foods health and beauty products. The wildest design scheme
        double complementary also known as Square presents two sets of
        complements or four distinct units. This style works very well across
        line extensions and ranges brands that offer multiple variances of
        similar products. However, when used within one single design, it
        becomes overwhelming which can actually be useful for some designs the
        use of two complementary pairs is very eye-catching but maybe even
        harder to apply successfully than one pair of complementary colors since
        more colors are more difficult to balance. If you use this type of
        scheme, you'll want to choose one of the four to be the dominant color
        and adjust the saturation value Etc of some or all the colors. So they
        work well in different parts of your design like the text and the
        background Newton is by far the largest contributor to color theory
        today, but both focused another approach the impact of color on human
        behavior specifically emotion and mood. He created the color triangle
        which functions the same as the color wheel as a reorganized way to use
        color within his templating theme. You can select different combinations
        of colors to reflect a specific emotion. For instance this cool blue and
        the warm red Can generate something like this the Pepsi Cola logo? And
        here we have several other color combinations displaying the emotions
        that those color combinations might evoke.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        And lastly we have it in who worked diligently to make the process of
        selecting colors painlessly simple many people disagree on the approach.
        We have access to millions of colors and in limits it to 84
        nevertheless. It's still an approach worth considering just like the
        color wheel the hidden star identifies warm and cool colors and the six
        color relationships, but also incorporates tones and shades making it
        more difficult to select which color ITN spent decades researching these
        ideal tints and shades. And here they are the 84 possible colors simple
        to the point and easy to use. Warm and cool combinations are possible
        along with the traditional color harmonies making the color star the
        absolute easiest color strategy possible.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        Remember this the goal here is to create a color palette. This takes
        time theory is a great place to start but there are other places that
        are just as resourceful. Nature should always be exploited when
        searching for perfectly balanced color palettes. There are many online
        applications. Now that can assist you in identifying simple color
        palettes in digital images. Also, there are ways to exploit successful
        Brands product campaigns and popular artwork. These are derived more
        culturally the naturally but are still impactful.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        Looking to the different historical periods in art movements for color
        inspiration can be another great technique these palettes below
        demonstrate the warm light-filled colors common to impressionist
        paintings. The Vivid unexpected combinations used by post Impressionists
        the soft earthy color characteristics of the Art Nouveau movement, and
        the bright bold Hues of pop art.

        Color plays a big role in our lives yellow and red traffic signs catch
        your attention and directly impact Behavior. As a matter of fact color
        is the international language that allows the 1.2 billion drivers on the
        road to Traverse safely. Most of the time anyway a red hexagon means
        stop and almost every nation regardless of whether you can read the
        word. We are drawn to colors on packaging and that reduction in the time
        to identify products coupled with increased attention time directly
        correlates with sales.

        We speak in terms of colors as feeling blue when we're sad and seeing
        red when we're angry colors have a direct impact on our emotions. The
        psychology and symbolism of color is interpreted differently around the
        world. But because Europe and North America have common ancestry. We
        generally have similar psychological reactions to color.

        Every color has its selling point. From the day that babies are brought
        home and cradled in their pink or blue blankets implications are made
        about gender and color while there are no concrete rules about what
        colors are exclusively feminine or masculine. There have been studies
        conducted over the past seven decades that draw some generalizations.
        Here's the 2003 study by Joe hillock. Color also has the unique ability
        to attract specific types of Shoppers and change shopping Behavior.
        Okay. So let's say you've selected a color palette now what?
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        Adding colors to a design involves a little more than choosing two or
        three Hues and plunking them down in equal parts in your layout
        effectively applying color to a design project has a lot to do with
        balance and the more colors you use the more complicated that balance is
        to achieve an easy way to think of this concept is by splitting your
        color choices into dominant in accent colors. The dominant color will be
        the most visible and most frequently used Hue in your design while one
        or more accent colors will complement in balance out that main color.
        Paying attention to how these colors interact with each other the amount
        of contrast the ease of readability when the text is involved how
        certain colors make others look when they're side by side what kind of
        mood or color combination creates Etc will help you fine-tune a perfect
        palette for your design purposes a common rule of thumb for using a
        basic three color palette and a design is known as the 60 30 10 rule.
        This approach is often used in interior design, but can also be
        effectively applied to web or print design projects. You simply make
        your dominant Hue account for 60% of the color in the design while to
        accent colors use up the remaining 30% and 10% a good analogy for
        understanding how this works is picturing a man's suit like this guy
        here the suit jacket and pants account for 60% of the color in the
        outfit the shirt accounts for 30% and the tie offers a small pop of
        color at 10% creating a balanced polished appearance.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        Use three to four colors Max in the design unless your intentionally
        trying to be excessive and have a full-on rainbow. Look. Use Shades
        intense of your three colors to add variety if required. The 60/30/10
        model is the gold standard for interior design and when you take a
        detailed look at well-designed packaging you'll see the same principle
        applied. So let's take a second to think about this. We have emotional
        and rational uses of color, but for packaging your print is not the only
        color you're working with. If you have a translucent transparent or an
        opaque primary package, you have the color of your product to consider
        in this mix along with any secondary packaging labeling closure
        container and the actual artwork. Keeping things simple is rule. Number
        one. You may be working with color set by manufacturing like your
        package product or the cap these need to be considered in the ultimate
        strategy as well. This graphic depicts a strategy. You can use to
        deleting the color combinations on your Packaging.

      <p className='mt-8 text-xl leading-8 dark:text-white'>
        Keep in mind your packaging substrate plays a big role in the ultimate
        presentation of the colors you select. There are many colors available
