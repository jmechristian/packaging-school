      'Expendable packaging is a necessity in all areas of the automotive supply chain. It is used by OEMs and process partners whenever returnable packaging usage is not feasible or available (e.g., a working one-way packaging solution has to be implemented to ensure deliveries overseas).   This course starts with an introduction to the automotive packaging industry and provides the fundamental knowledge necessary to get you up to speed in this vast sector of packaging. We’ll overview the packaging processes involved in packaging production, overseas distribution, and after sales operations.   The following lessons will walk you through the different materials that are used in automotive packaging and transportation. You will be introduced to major expendable packaging materials such as corrugated containers and boxes, wood packaging solutions for automotive applications, protective packaging and dunnage solutions, films and bags, and much more. Corrosion control methods and packaging solutions as well as their importance in the automotive industry are covered extensively in this course.',

      'This course will explore methods, materials, and equipment at the forefront of barrier technologies. It will also provide an introduction to the predictive M-RULE® Container Performance Model and analytical testing methods that can be utilized to determine the most suitable barrier solution for a specific product. Though numerous technical solutions exist for PET bottles and hopes remain high for barrier alternatives, no single technology has been shown to satisfy the broad needs of brand owners and consumers. The pros and cons of each barrier technology are weighed in this presentation. In addition to bottle gas barrier technologies, closure and light barrier technologies are also examined.',
