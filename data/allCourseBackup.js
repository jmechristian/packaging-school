      'The last of this series describes the importance of developing strain-hardened crystals during blow molding to produce bottles with optimum properties. Techniques commonly used to measure the amount of crystallinity in the bottle are discussed. The concept of the Natural Stretch Ratio (NSR) of PET is reviewed and how it must be considered when designing and blowing preforms. The concept of heat-setting is introduced in order to reduce the stress that develops in a blown bottle. Lastly a number of common myths pertaining to PET bottles are discussed.',

      'The second part of this series reviews current manufacturers of PET and how this material is used to make not just bottles but fibers, filaments, and sheet goods. PET manufacture is described using today’s reliance on petroleum and natural gas to new technologies capable of producing the required monomers through bio-synthetic pathways. Current polymerization processes are reviewed that are used to produce materials with sufficiently high molecular weight, or Intrinsic Viscosity (IV) for use in bottle manufacture. The criticality of IV, from how it is measured through its impact on preform and bottle manufacture is introduced.',
