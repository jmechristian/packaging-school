              Sustainability is more than a buzzword . . . it is a vital and
              ongoing journey for firms and virtually every industry, especially
              packaging! Meeting customer demands and ensuring regulatory
              compliance requires embedding sustainability principles into the
              packaging concept phase, considering the entire lifecycle to
              minimize environmental impacts and ensure efficient and
              cost-effective systemsâ€”from cradle to grave.

              To that end, the Packaging School has crafted a self-paced online
              program to equip learners to fluently communicate in the language
              of sustainability, set and achieve UN-based sustainability
              targets, design sustainable systems, measure carbon footprints,
              attain carbon neutrality through offset programs, and integrate an
              ISO 14040 compliant life cycle assessment (LCA) software into
              their packaging design workflow and material selection processes.
