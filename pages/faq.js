      <div className='flex flex-col gap-4'>
        <div>
          We embrace MicroLearning! Smartphones have accustomed us to accessing
          the information we need at rapid speed and in short bursts. Long
          training sessions, multiple day workshops, and huge manuals are not a
          desirable way to learn information. Instead, we use a technique called
          MicroLearning to break difficult topics down into lessons of
          bite-sized chunks that students can engage with on any device. These
          lessons take the form of infographics, quick readings, videos,
          animations, discussions, and interactive slides. This delivery method
          empowers students to complete courses at their leisure, when they’re
          ready to learn, and still gain an essential education.
        </div>
        <div>
          Short, focused sessions (less than 7 minutes) avoid mental burnout and
          suit the brain with respect to energy and alertness. Bite-sized
          content perfectly suits an information-rich lifestyle because it
          enables learners to access small chunks of information instantly,
          anytime, and from anywhere. And because microlearning is short and
          seemingly current, trainees can rest easy that the content is up to
          date, correct, and meaningful to their work.
        </div>
        <div>
          Courses are organized by Modules, which are composed of Lessons and
          cover 3-5 Learning Goals over an hour-long engagement period. All
          lessons are unique, so the number of lessons it takes to communicate a
          course varies. In our experience, most courses incorporate 1-8 hours
          of engagement.
