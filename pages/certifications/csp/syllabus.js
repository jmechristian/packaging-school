              Asynchronous learning will be deployed, meaning that the

              course content at different times (and from different locations).
              As each assignment is completed, the instructors will guide the
              students, provide them with feedback, and make assessments as
              needed on assignments and activities.&nbsp;

            <p>
              The Packaging School requires all students to have access to a
              computer and at least 3 mbps of internet. Student services will
              provide students with suggestions as to how to get access to the
              internet and/or a computer if requested. All other requirements to
              complete any course or assignment within the Packaging School are
              embedded in the learning management system. Students will not be
              asked to purchase any other technology in order to complete the
              program. The lessons are accessible from any smartphone or tablet.
              Chrome is the recommended web browser. At this time, students may
              not download any material for offline viewing unless it is
              intuitive to do so. Students are responsible for their own
              computer maintenance.

              Any breach of the principles outlined in the Academic Integrity

            <p>
              If a student(s) has complaints about a course situation, they
              should first attempt to resolve the situation with the instructor:
              Dr. Suggs, Julie@packagingschool.com 864-412-5000.

              If a resolution cannot be made with the instructor, or if the
              complaint is about a general school policy over which the
              instructor has no jurisdiction, then the student(s) may contact
              the school director for mediation: Drew Felty, CEO{' '}

              <strong>Grading Policies:&nbsp;</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Students&apos; progress throughout the program is monitored
              through the Learning Management System (LMS). Courses include
              multiple knowledge checks and a final exam, which assess the
              student&apos;s comprehension of the course&apos;s learning
              objectives. Knowledge checks are not graded. However, they must be
              completed. Knowledge checks test retention of the teachings and
              help the student prepare for the final exam. Passing the course
              requires an 80% or greater on the final exam. Student completion
              progress is presented with the completion of every lesson in the
              LMS. Grades are reported to students at the end of each course and
              a final grade is submitted upon completion of the final exam.
              Students are notified by email each week if they have outstanding
              course material that has not been completed. Transcripts will be
              held digitally and are considered Permanent Records which are held
              indefinitely. Attendance is recorded for each login session in the
              LMS, and all engagement with the program is monitored.&nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>Grading Scale</p>
            <p> 0–79% = Fail</p>
            <p> 80–100% = Pass</p>

            <p>
              Students must pass the final exam in each course in order to
              successfully complete the course. Students must successfully
              complete every course in the program&apos;s curriculum in order to
              receive the certificate of completion at the end of the program.

            </p>
            <p>
              The Packaging School requires students to set up an account and
              password in order to access all course work. Students are
              encouraged to protect their password and account. Only one student
              per account is permitted. IP addresses are monitored to ensure
              that students are not sharing their account with individuals in
              another location. Proctoring software is used during exams to
              ensure that students are who they say they are. Accredible is used
              to verify that the same person who completes coursework and
              assignments receives the certificate and digital badge.
