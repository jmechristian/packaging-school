            “If you’re looking to increase your Packaging IQ. Here’s a good
            start! Despite having a degree in packaging and having worked in the
            industry for nearly 10 years, I still learned quite a bit. Very
            proud to share this achievement! Thank you Prof. Andrew Hurley, PhD,
            Julie Rice Suggs, PhD, and everyone at The Packaging School for
            putting together this program. It was a lot of fun and well
            designed! Cheers!”
